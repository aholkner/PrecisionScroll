# PrecisionScroll

When this extension is installed, the trackpad scrolling behaviour of the code editor in Visual Studio is smooth and pixel-accurate, instead of scrolling line-by-line.

This extension was originally built for VS 2017, but no longer seems to compile, and needs upgrading to work with VS 2019 or 2022.

This extension is based on [SmoothScroll](https://github.com/lkytal/SmoothScroll) from some time ago.
